It is common to hear from people working with data that they have a clear choice between R and Python.  We were curious to know if there could be a specific reason underlying such choice. After some brainstorming, we came up with the hypothesis that a person's choice between R and Python might be due to their preference in a specific data science task such as **data visualization**, **data wrangling** and **machine learning**.  We have set the goal to explore such causal relationship (if there exists one) with data in our data analysis project.
