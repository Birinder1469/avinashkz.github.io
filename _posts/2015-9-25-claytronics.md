‘Claytronics’ is a concept of the future which aims to break the barrier in transferring and transforming tangible 3D objects. The concept is to make an object to be composed of millions of programmed nanoscale robots and to move them relative to each other in a controlled, coordinated manner to change shape and other properties of the body. Claytronics has the potential to greatly affect many areas of daily life, such as telecommunication, human-computer interface, entertainment, etc.
